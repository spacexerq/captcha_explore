# Captcha solver

To run the solver open any of release.ipynb or release_test.ipynb
/archive/ contains failed model with artificial noise as lines separation

This model is now working only for captchas with usual string symbols any colors

model.bin and model_finish.bin - pytorch model files, could be launched to test predictions by data_loader

Actually, release and relesae_test (as well as model and model_finish) have to has no difference due to just parallel testing of then on different PCs
